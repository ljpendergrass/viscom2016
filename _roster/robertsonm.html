intro: I was born in Montr√©al, grew up in Portland, and now live in Seattle. I spend my time training in the aerial arts, painting, collaging, photographing, designing and traveling.
extra: I got my start in the creative realm early in my schooling when I went to an art school for three years in middle school that introduced me to everything from ballroom dancing to painting to website coding. In high school I took classes like yearbook, general art, and quilting, and was avidly apart of the drama department as well. All this led me to the beginning of university and wondering what I could possibly do in the real world that could unite the passion I had developed for communicating visually, understanding, interacting and successfully communicating with an audience. Cue graphic design - the career path that I excitedly attempted to explain to my mum senior year of high school that seemed like a pie in the sky idea which has turned into an amazing formal education here at SPU that has prepared and excited me for a future career as a designer.

<p>Promotional poster for an aerial arts installation. The aerial arts are an intricate and fluid art form, manipulated and defined by the audience's intentions, exposure, and preconceived notions of purpose or use. I wanted to capture this sense of limitless possibilities of shape and form building that would be seen and experienced &#8212; from the many shapes of the aerial apparatus' to the constantly shifting forms and functionality determined and created by the audience's interaction.</p>
