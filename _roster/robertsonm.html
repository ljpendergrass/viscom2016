intro: I was born in Montr√©al, grew up in Portland, and now live in Seattle. I spend my time training in the aerial arts, painting, collaging, photographing, designing and traveling.

<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/highrise.jpg">
<p>Promotional poster for an aerial arts installation. The aerial arts are an intricate and fluid art form, manipulated and defined by the audience's intentions, exposure, and preconceived notions of purpose or use. I wanted to capture this sense of limitless possibilities of shape and form building that would be seen and experienced &#8212; from the many shapes of the aerial apparatus' to the constantly shifting forms and functionality determined and created by the audience's interaction.</p>
