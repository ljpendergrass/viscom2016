intro: I am a Northwest native that is passionate about his work and eager to make an impression on the design community.
extra: It's been on my mind since high school that design was the career path for me. But what's changed in that time are my interests and focuses within the field. A mini life crisis at the end of junior year led to a realization that graphic design isn't particularly my favorite, and I became worried that I had made a huge college mistake. But as I moved into senior year and began a new set of classes, I was reminded that I am not a graphic design major. I may do graphic design work and understand the concepts of graphic design, but as a Visual Communications major I have much more than that to offer! This major has equipped me with the ability to use design as a tool that translates across multiple areas of design such as website, UI/UX, and motion design, not just graphic design that I had previously assumed was my limitation. And so, as I graduate in a matter of weeks I feel equipped as a designer that can use my skill sets to be successful in various areas of design, no matter where my career takes me.
