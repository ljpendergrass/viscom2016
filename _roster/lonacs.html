intro: Originally from the Bay Area in California, I have loved studying design in the exciting city of Seattle.
extra: I've always had an obsession with art and design, finding the beauty of design in my everyday life. I believe in the power of design, and how vital it is to consider the user in every facet of my work. I love taking a brand from conception and ideation, all the way to a finalized and fully developed narrative. Aside from my passion with all things design, I can be found photographing my friends, trying new restaurants, and traveling along the West Coast. I look forward to delving into the word of design and putting my stamp on the creative industry.

<h3>Introspect</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/Introspect_Web.jpg">
<p>Introspect is an app designed to create a space for people with mental illness to share their emotions, feelings, and thoughts with their loved ones. People with mental illness often don't know how to explain what they're going through to their close friends and family, and in return the loved one doesn't know how to help or speak to someone about their mental illness. Introspect helps users start that difficult conversation, and allows users to have a private and inviting space for introspection. </p>
<h3>LaPizzeria</h3>

<p>Rehival is a small cafe that will be opening in the heart of the Capitol Hill neighborhood in Seattle. What makes rehival unique is their rooftop garden where not only do they grow fruit and vegetables that will be used in their cafe’s food, but their rooftop is home to honeybee hives. The honey from these bees is sold and featured in many of the products that they sell in their café, where they also hire and trains ex-convicts to aid them in the process of reintegration into society. Working together with the founders and other designers to conceptualize a name and look for the company, I developed a brand to reflect the style and mission of Rehival.</p>
<h3>Rehival</h3>

<p>La Pizzeria is an Italian pizzeria focused on creating food in authentic Italian methods, but with a modern twist. For the rebrand of the existing location in the small downtown of Campbell, California, I wanted to pull the authentic and modern styles together for the new look. I handcrafted a handmade type that brought the authentic and handcrafted cooking techniques together. Pairing this organic and handmade look with the modern and geometric Italian character, Antonio, the result was a modern and sleek rebrand with a handmade touch. </p>
