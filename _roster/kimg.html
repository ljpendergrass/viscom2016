<h3>Choose the Healthier Snack</h3>

<p>This project was for AIGA's Design for Good Seattle. It is a design-driven social change platform that focused on the theme of food. For this movement, I designed a poster that promoted healthy eating in families.The red color palette was used to help create a gender, race, and age neutral environment when parentes and kids read the poster.</p>
<h3>MOD Pizza Rebrand</h3>

pI have always been a fan of Mod's pizza when it opened in my neighborhood. The fun and unique environment really made it comfortable for everyone to eat at. Because I fell in love with the vibes that Mod was giving off, I wanted to create something fun to the brand. I illustrated a personalized face to their top pizzas. They already had cool names and I thought it would be a fun project to see a face to these names. It really speaks into their motto of making Mod your own.
<h3>The Five</h3>

<p>I have always wanted to work on my communication skills. Especially when I run into misunderstandings in the professional field. After research, I learned that everyone has a dominant voice. The way someone communicates is distinct and personal to that individual and there are 5 voices that exist. They are called, cultivators, innovators, guardians, connectors and pioneers. Everyone has the capacity to use these different 'voices' but some are just more natural to us than others. Each voice has strengths and weaknesses and I wanted to incorporate a conference that utilizes these untapped voices in people. Especially in women that are working in the design field. I created a mark that encompassed the voices in women and illustrated female hands in these marks. I wanted to portray something that was delicate yet strong as each voice is being embraced by these hands of different women.</p>
