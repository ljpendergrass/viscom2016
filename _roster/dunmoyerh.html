intro: I'm a wide-eyed, coffee guzzling, designer who gets ignited by the idea of tactile and experimental design that makes you think.
extra: It’s a multifaceted sport of design out there in this boundless world, and my interests lie mostly in the realm of print and editorial devices. I get a little too stoked when quality details such a letterpress, or 100lb savoy cotton paper are being discussed. Aside from the glamour of excellent print,  I get fearlessly inspired when I consider a new concept and have the opportunity to use design to unpack this. My greatest excitement comes from picking apart a story or idea, and piecing it all back together visually, especially when I consider new and experimental ways of going about this. Design can be more than a tool that communicates clearly, it can also be a method to spark new ideas, problem solve, and even inspire others to dig a little deeper.

<h3>Seed Bomb</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/Heather_BOMB.jpg">
	<p>A project that was introduced to me when I was studying abroad at Central Saint Martins. It considered the culture of London, as well as conveying a complex idea through design.</p>
<p>The prompt: convey a day in the life of a favorite London location. I chose Skip Garden a community garden and cafe nearby, that has mobile planters so they can move locations periodically. In a typical day, an individual eats three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I began thinking about how I could capture the goal of this community garden and cafe. The solution, a seed bomb. A small compact gumball-sized “bomb” that contains the seeds to grow. Packaging lent a hand to communicate the mission of Skips, while the bomb incapsulated the goal of sharing and spreading growth and education of how to be self-sustaining.</p>

<h3>PERIPHERAL Conference</h3>

<p>When I consider my study habits,  I realize that I work best in coffee shops. The issue that I often run into at these coffee shops, is that I often struggle to find which location is least crowded, has available outlets to plug in my devices, or has ideal parking in a busy city such as Seattle. My problem to solve for this app, would be to determine beforehand how busy a location I desired to go is, what the outlet usage looks like, and what the parking situation is. Planning, wire framing, mapping, adjusting, prototyping, guerrilla testing, user testing, evaluating and always adjusting was the model of execution for this UI/UX project.  I learned quickly how to solve user problems and evaluate how someone would interact with the device. The end was a completed application concept model that aims to make your life less busy, despite the daily buzz we endure.

<h3>BUZY App</h3>

<p>Peripheral Vision is a concept project that was focused around a theoretical design conference. The task was to learn about the entirety of what goes into developing  a conference from idea to final execution. The problem that I wanted to address in this project was how I can design a conference that comments on staying innovative and experimental in a very structured field, but also remaining relevant and purposeful. The goal is to inform the emerging generation how innovative and creative problem solving can be the solution to design. Coming to a solution meant developing the ins-and-outs of how I wanted my conference to communicate. This required research, prototyping, branding, posters, pamphlet mailers, conference handouts, games, tote bags, the list continues. It is an incredible amount of work, but the result resolved the problem of the need for a conference that aimed to inspire and cultivate creativity in an innovative and inventive manner.</p>
