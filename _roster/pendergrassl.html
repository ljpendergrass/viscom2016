intro: I've always known that I want to make, not do. I see beauty in music, art, design, and code, and chase the feeling of being in a creative trance.
extra: Three years ago, if you told me that by the time I could drink legally I would be comfortable with the command line, HTML, CSS/CSS Preprocessors, and a little javascript, I would have laughed in your face. I may still do that anyways, but please don't be offended. That's just what I do sometimes.<br><br>You can trace the thread of my nerdy creativity all the way back to the first time I opened up Win 98 mspaint. Mspaint led me to GIMP, GIMP lead me to Photoshop, and Photoshop tipped me into a world full of digital opportunities. Secretly, I still want to be a character designer, but until I can take a full complement of anatomy courses, I'll be comfortable surfing the wires, building websites and slinging styles.

<h3>Colophon</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/project_1.jpg">

<p>You can <a href="http://www.loganpendergrass.com/colophon-dev">interact with the <em>Colophon</em> prototype</a>. <em>Colophon</em> is currently a mobile-only front end prototype.</p>
<p>Information about calligraphy is spread all over the dang place. I believe that this information should be easily accessible and shared; same for the wonderful pieces that people create. Colophon allows users to access and share their pieces, knowledge, and insights about anything calligraphy or lettering related.</p>


<h3>SPU Repsonsive Retrofit</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/project_2.jpg">
<p>In August 2015, SPU re-launched the main part of it's website in a responsive format. SPU worked with digital firm Domain 7 to complete the retrofit. I helped out in small ways across the site, but a project I had all to myself was the coding of new responsive views for the <a href="http://spu.edu/calendar">SPU Master Calendar.</a></p>
<h3>Graphogrammetry</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/project_3.jpg">
<p>Graphogrammetry is a fictional conference focused on bridging the gap between designer and developer. An identity, conference booklet, and poster for Graphogrammetry were developed within the Visual Communications 3 course at Seattle Pacific University, which focused on the theme of Design Research.</p>
