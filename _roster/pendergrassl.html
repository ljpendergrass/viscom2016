intro: I've always known that I want to make, not do. I see beauty in music, art, design, and code, and chase the feeling of being in a creative trance.

<h3>Colophon</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/project_1.jpg">

<p>You can <a href="http://www.loganpendergrass.com/colophon-dev">interact with the <em>Colophon</em> prototype</a>. <em>Colophon</em> is currently a mobile-only front end prototype.</p>
<p>Information about calligraphy is spread all over the dang place. I believe that this information should be easily accessible and shared; same for the wonderful pieces that people create. Colophon allows users to access and share their pieces, knowledge, and insights about anything calligraphy or lettering related.</p>


<h3>SPU Repsonsive Retrofit</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/project_2.jpg">
<p>In August 2015, SPU re-launched the main part of it's website in a responsive format. SPU worked with digital firm Domain 7 to complete the retrofit. I helped out in small ways across the site, but a project I had all to myself was the coding of new responsive views for the <a href="http://spu.edu/calendar">SPU Master Calendar.</a></p>
<h3>Graphogrammetry</h3>

<p>Graphogrammetry is a fictional conference focused on bridging the gap between designer and developer. An identity, conference booklet, and poster for Graphogrammetry were developed within the Visual Communications 3 course at Seattle Pacific University, which focused on the theme of Design Research.</p>
