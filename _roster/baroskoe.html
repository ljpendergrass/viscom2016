intro: Charms, colors, and all things magic. You'll find me trying to make sense of this life by discovering the beauty in the nuances of every-day-life.

extra: After growing up in multiple unique locations across the country, these days my heart is content to remain in the Pacific Northwest. I've grown to be adaptable and fluid – aware that life is finicky and our time here is precious. My story as I know it is unfolding – quietly, but surely and steadily.<br><br>I believe in people and their stories, and strive to tell these stories through my design work and my personhood. Everything in this world is connected on some level and we use art and design as a facilitator to make these connections come to life. As a tool of connection, communication, and inspiration, design becomes a crucial medium.
