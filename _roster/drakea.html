<h3>Intent</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/intent_foreword16-02-web.jpg">
<p>This design research conference brings together innovators, entrepreneurs and designers alike. It is two days of looking at approach, failure and perception. We want to reinforce intention; whether its a product, an idea, or a company, these innovators pushed boundaries to see their idea come to full fruition.
