intro: I'm a food-loving Seattle native excited about design.
extra: What gets me excited about design is its ability to communicate, whether that be a story behind a product, business or an idea. I could play with type all day but what Iâ€™ve found I really enjoy is the conceptual idea-creating behind design. The problem solving, the getting your hands dirty and working within the limitations. Design is always changing but its the foundation of a concept that will carry it through.<br><br>In the future I hope to work in branding and marketing to help tell these stories, large or small.

<h3>Intent</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/intent_foreword16-02-web.jpg">
<p>This design research conference brings together innovators, entrepreneurs and designers alike. It is two days of looking at approach, failure and perception. We want to reinforce intention; whether its a product, an idea, or a company, these innovators pushed boundaries to see their idea come to full fruition.
