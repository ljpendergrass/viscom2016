intro: I'm just a fine artist turned graphic designer whose passion is to create beautiful things. You may have heard about me as “The Girl With the Hair”. You will commonly see me with a cup of coffee in hand, or pointing out the nearest dog. Don’t let my sarcasm scare you, that just means we are friends.
extra: Sometimes obscure concepts or unfamiliar programs can be intimidating, but I never let them get in the way of the best possible solution to a problem. “Good enough” is not an option. I am very meticulous and detail-oriented with my work. I get a little too excited with the little details of design, whether thats a subtle pattern, beautiful type, or even the feeling of a nice, cotton paper - those small, extra details matter.<br><br>While my early creative stages were solely focused on drawing and illustration, I have grown in my knowledge of design and have found a new love in interactive and motion. My inspiration stems from knowing that design can have a huge impact on people. I don’t know exactly what the future will hold, but I am excited to call myself a creative in this world of design."
