intro: My work is driven by my calling to cultivate a transformative social impact in everything I create. Through my career, I hope to tackle an array of problems that crave creative solutions.
extra: I’m a quiet extravert who loves making connections between ideas and people. I believe that all design should change lives, even if that just means brightening someone’s day. I will not settle for generic design. There is always a design solution that has never been done before. Uncovering and polishing these new ideas is what excites me most about graphic design. I hope to work in a creative agency where I can be part of a team working on many diverse projects with a variety of clients. I want to continue learning about all aspects of graphic design and delve into both the digital and print worlds. Outside of design, I enjoy crocheting, whistling, having good conversations, and collecting cassette tapes.<br><br>If I could be any animal, I would be an otter.

<p>Although acne affects most of us, we do not know how deep it really goes. This infographic poster goes beneath the surface, taking viewers on a journey of understanding the mental and emotional effects of acne. I performed firsthand and secondhand research in order to develop this project.</p>
