intro: I am a calm, reserved, and soft-spoken human being <!-- INCREDIBLY TENDER BOY DO NOT WOUND -->— until you get to know me. That’s when the sarcasm, dry humor, and puns emerge — along with sincere camaraderie, of course.

<p>Motion design opens a whole new door when it comes to visual storytelling. Unlike print or other static forms of design, motion incorporates time. This can be either an advantage or challenge, depending on how you look at it. Either way, motion is something I have fallen in love with and here is a little taste. </p>
<h3>Uncharted</h3>

<p>The goal of Uncharted is to excite both experienced and emerging designers about the future of typography and inspire unprecedented typographic exploration and innovation. Because the conference seeks to appeal to both sophisticated and youthful designers, the visual style needed to represent a sense of class but also reflect a fun side. </p></p>
<h3>Aquire</h3>

<p>People want to know. They want to know how to build something, how to play something, or how to accomplish something they could not before. Learning through human contact is the best form of learning. With Acquire, users can choose a skill they want to learn, find a local professional in that field, and set up a lesson or tutoring session that opens the floodgates of knowledge. </p>
