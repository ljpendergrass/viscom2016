<h3>Murmur Branding</h3>

<p>Getting its name from the onomatopoetic term for speaking in a hushed tone, Murmur was the implementation of a children's monitoring technology company. These took the approachable nature of a lemur and calmness of a circle, and combined them into the current Murmur logo and lock up. The abstracted logo of the lemur utilizes the white of the fur as the negative space interacting with the black. The the black forms were made to be as large as possible to keep the simplicity of a logo while still conveying lemur.</p>

<h3>Cascade Yearbook</h3>

<p>A yearbook is intended to capture the perfect snapshot of the year that just had passed. The Cascade is Seattle Pacific University's year in review. Our challenge this year was to rethink why people by a yearbook. The goal this year was to showcase the entire year with a minimal aesthetic, holding to a swiss type style while creating a unique container for our photographs to live in.</p>

<h3>Breathe</h3>

<p>Anxiety is hard, and during panic attacks, it’s often hard to vocalize needs and feelings to those that support you. Breathe is an application for managing anxiety by bringing a circle of people, who are emotionally close, called their “inner circle.” The app is a haven for each user offering calming breathing exercises, a means to communicate to friends, and other useful resources.</p>
