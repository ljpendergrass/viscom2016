intro: Hi! I'm Julia, originally from Riga, Latvia. I am a passionate designer/world traveler who loves to drink tea with milk, practice hot yoga on a daily basis, and take good care of our five cats! 
extra: Originally from Riga Latvia, I've always had an immense passion for art and design. I am always excited to grow as a designer, and believe the best way of doing so is emerging yourself into a completely different culture and environment! I got to study Studio Art and Design in Rome, Italy through the University of Washington, and in the summer of 2015 I got to study Graphic Design in The Hague, Netherlands through College for Creative studies.<br><br>I believe that a designer can use their work to increase public awareness of a variety of social issues. We are able to solve problems using design systems thinking. In order to create good design, it is essential to understand today's society by knowing the needs and wants of clients and users. My goal as a designer is to keep pushing myself, never stop learning, and keep traveling/discovering new ways in which design can change someone's life for the better. "

<h3>FLOW UI / UX Conference</h3>

<p>FLOW is a User Experience and User Interface Design Conference occurring in the city of Amsterdam. UI / UX may seem intimidating to some, that's why I made sure to create a fun, creative, and comfortable brand. A poster and a booklet was created for the conference. </p>

<h3>Heeven</h3>

<p>Throughout our world, the abundance and diversity of flowers has declined, the bees are constantly exposed to agrochemicals, and novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change will most likely make these problems worse in the future. All of that is declining the honeybee population. What can we, as humans do to stop the decline of honeybee population?In order to preserve the honeybee population, I decided to re-brand a local, organic bee company, as well as provide consumers with the ability to plant flowers which attract honeybees.
