<h3>FLOW UI / UX Conference</h3>
<img src="../roster/{{ page.user }}/flow-web.jpg">
<p>FLOW is a User Experience and User Interface Design Conference occurring in the city of Amsterdam. UI / UX may seem intimidating to some, that's why I made sure to create a fun, creative, and comfortable brand. A poster and a booklet was created for the conference. </p>
<h3>BUDGE</h3>

<p>This application is for those who love to travel, attend exciting and new events and are on a specific budget. A user is able to choose their location, budget, date and time. They are then able to see a list of exciting events happening in the area selected. They can filter the results to their liking as well as purchase tickets to events right away.</p>
<h3>Heeven</h3>

<p>Throughout our world, the abundance and diversity of flowers has declined, the bees are constantly exposed to agrochemicals, and novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change will most likely make these problems worse in the future. All of that is declining the honeybee population. What can we, as humans do to stop the decline of honeybee population?In order to preserve the honeybee population, I decided to re-brand a local, organic bee company, as well as provide consumers with the ability to plant flowers which attract honeybees.
